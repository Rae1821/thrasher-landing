## Overview

### The challenge

Users (a.k.a the residents of Thrasher Landing) requested:

- A simple site to house our neighborhood documents, any upcoming events, and a list of our board members
- Needed a responsive site that looked good on mobile as majority of the users accessed the site from their phones
- Needed it to be intuitive and user friendly for users of all ages
